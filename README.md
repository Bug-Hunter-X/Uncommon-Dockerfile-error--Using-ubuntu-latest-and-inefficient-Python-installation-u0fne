This repository demonstrates a common but often overlooked error in Dockerfiles: using the `ubuntu:latest` image and installing Python without a virtual environment.  The `Dockerfile` shows the problematic code, while `Dockerfile_fixed` provides a robust and reproducible alternative.  Always specify a version of base images and use virtual environments for Python projects in Docker to prevent dependency conflicts and improve reproducibility.
